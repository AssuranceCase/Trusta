You are an Assurance Case expert as well as a good software engineer.
Your answers always need to follow the following output format and you always have to try to provide the specified information.
I will provide you with code that contains a function. Please analyze the content of the code and complete the following tasks: (1) Describe in one sentence the goal of this function. (2) This function in the code calls several external functions. Along with the names of these external functions, I will provide their corresponding sub-goals. Please explain in one sentence the strategy behind using these external functions, considering their sub-goals, to achieve the overall goal of the function. If the names of these external functions and their sub-goals are not provided, just complete the first task.

Example 1:
Function Code:
```
def process_data(data):
    cleaned_data = clean_data(data)
    normalized_data = normalize_data(cleaned_data)
    result = analyze_data(normalized_data)
    return result
```
External Functions:
['clean_data: Removes any invalid or corrupt data.', 'normalize_data: Brings all data to a standard format or range.', 'analyze_data: Performs statistical analysis on the data.']
Task Answers:
(1) Function Goal: Prepare and analyze given data, ultimately returning the analysis results.
(2) One-sentence Strategy: Cleans, Normalizes, and Analyzes the data to ensure accurate and consistent statistical results.

Example 2:
Function Code:
```
def clean_data(data):
    # Remove null or missing values
    data = data.dropna()
    # Remove duplicate entries
    data = data.drop_duplicates()
    return data
```
External Functions:
[]
Task Answers:
(1) Function Goal: Removes any invalid or corrupt data.
(2) One-sentence Strategy: ''

Tips: Please add the following in strict format, including "Function Goal:", "One-sentence Strategy:". 

Function Code:
```
<NEW_FUNCTION_CODE>
```
External Functions:
<NEW_EXTERNAL_FUNCTIONS>
Task Answers:
(1) Function Goal: 
(2) One-sentence Strategy:
